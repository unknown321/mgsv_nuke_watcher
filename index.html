	<h1>FOB event info:</h1>
	<p>Name: Bound Dragons</p><p>Description: We've received a new contract from small-time PF "NO ALERT." They claim that the hardline PF "KILL COUNT" has been repeatedly abducting and interrogating NO ALERT personnel. The mission objective is to infiltrate a KILL COUNT platform, extract as many prisoners as possible and reach the goal point.</p><p>Specified Period: 2021/06/22 to 2021/07/06 (YYYY/MM/DD)</p>
	<h1>Other events:</h1>
	<p>Name: Mosquito's Legacy</p><p>Description: A former comrade, Mosquito, once plotted to take over Mother Base in his mad pursuit to exact revenge on Big Boss. The stronghold of the PF he commanded has been located. There, remnants of Mosquito's PF are attempting to rebuild the organization. Make sure this does not happen. Infiltrate the enemy platform, and make it to the core.</p><hr><p>Name: New World Order</p><p>Description: Upstart PFs are appearing all over the globe. Though inspired by Diamond Dogs, their reckless actions, motivated by money, have brought chaos to our areas of operations. Not only have they brought discredit to the PF industry, they are now on the verge of triggering new conflicts. One of these PFs, known as "No Alert," has requested that we infiltrate their rival "Kill Count." Your mission is to infiltrate the base and put Kill Count's personnel and materials to better use in Diamond Dogs.</p><hr><p>Name: Freedom from Oppression</p><p>Description: Under contract from the embattled up-and-coming PF "NO ALERT," we are to mount an assault against "KILL COUNT," a PF whose hardline business policies have seen them chew through countless mercenaries and worsen the violence in conflict regions, all while filling their own pockets. 
The mission objective is to liberate local soldiers who are being oppressed by the KILL COUNT upper echelons. 
Infiltrate the enemy platform and reach the goal point, extracting or eliminating as many enemy soldiers as possible along the way.</p><hr><p>Name: Skulls Attack</p><p>Description: An FOB belonging to rookie PF "NO ALERT" has suddenly come under attack by remnants of the Skulls. We believe some other PF with a grudge against NO ALERT has sent in captured Skulls as bio-weapons.
The men staffing the FOB have been turned to puppet soldiers, bringing a halt to the FOB's functions. NO ALERT has offered us an emergency contract to resolve the problem.
Your mission objective is to eliminate the 4 Skulls occupying the FOB.</p><hr><p>Name: [EASY] Mosquito's Legacy</p><p>Name: [EASY] New World Order</p><p>Name: [EASY] Bound Dragons</p><p>Name: [EASY] Freedom from Oppression</p><p>Name: [EASY] Skulls Attack</p><p>Name: [HARD] Mosquito's Legacy</p><p>Name: [HARD] New World Order</p><p>Name: [HARD] Bound Dragons</p><p>Name: [HARD] Freedom from Oppression</p><p>Name: [HARD] Skulls Attack</p>
